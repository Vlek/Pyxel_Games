Pyxel Gameplan: Pong

Next steps:
	1) Finish Player paddle collisions with the ball
		~Won't need top and bottom paddle collisions since the pong ball shouldn't collide
		 with the top anyway
		~Have the ball increase by a factor of .33 when it reaches the edge most portions of 
		 the paddle
		~The ball will move in a different direction from where it originally traveled
			I.E) if the ball came from bottom right and travels top left and hits the
				bottom of the paddle, the ball should continue traveling in the +y	
				direction, but if it hits the top of the paddle, it should travel in 
				the -y direction
	2) Implement enemy paddle colisions with the ball
		~Mimics the same properties of the player paddle
	3) Create a reset function that replaces the ball in the center of the screen once the ball reaches
	    one of the sides
	4) Develop an AI that allows for the player to play against the computer
		~Potentially could be an attempt to line up the center of the paddle with the ball?
	5) Develop a counter to keep track of the game points.
		~Play to 5 for now.
Potential Features:
	-starting menu
	-computer vs computer mode
	-endless mode?

Plans for today:
	1) Refamiliarize myself with the code
	2) Make some QOL improvements
	3) Potentially refactor the code
